Project Description - A Modern Looking Task Manager
  - This is important to us because we are going to utilize WinAPI functions like OpenProcess to enumerat eprocess identifiers for each process object in the system
  - Languages and Technologies - WinAPI, C++, QT GUI framework
  - This project will create an application, such that it will be similar to Windows Task Manager, instead using QT for GUI and controls such as a ListView to enumerate    the processes running on your Windows system 
  - Input / Output - Basic GUI that takes user input and produces output in the form of data about the usage of processes on a Windows system (CPU usage, RAM usage, DISK   usage, NETWORK usage). Input functionalities will be restricted to ending the process via a right-click operation that produces a context menu with an end-process       function. If time permits, possibly add a details button to the context menu to see the path to the file that is running, its executable name, etc.
